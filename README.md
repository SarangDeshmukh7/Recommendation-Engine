## Type of Data:
- There are 17770 unique movie IDs.
- There are 480189 unique user IDs.
- There are ratings. Ratings are on a five star (integral) scale from 1 to 5.
- There is a date on which the movie is watched by the user in the format YYYY-MM-DD.


## Content-based Filtering:

Content-based Filtering works on the principle that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, means based on userâ€™s previous preferences it recommends the product.

## Collaborative Filtering:

Collaborative Filtering works on a principle of correlation. It considers the common interest shared by two or more people.

## AutoEncoders:

Autoencoder is an unsupervised artificial neural network that learns how to efficiently compress and encode data then learns how to reconstruct the data back from the reduced encoded representation to a representation that is as close to the original input as possible.

## Boltzmann Machine:

A restricted Boltzmann machine is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.
